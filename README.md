# Presentation

Presentation packages are part of the [iTwin.js library](https://www.itwinjs.org/). The packages' responsibility is to help application developers bring non-graphical [iModels'](https://www.itwinjs.org/learning/imodels/) data to users, by solving the following problems:

- Format property values according to user's preferences (language, locale, unit system, etc.).
- Calculate display labels for instances of different [ECClasses](https://www.itwinjs.org/bis/ec/ec-class/).
- Gather associated data from different areas of an iModel and return it in a way that's easy to present to users.
- Create hierarchies from [iModel](https://www.itwinjs.org/learning/imodels/) (and not only) data.
- Provide components to present non-graphical iModel data to users. This includes tree, table, property grid and some other components and their building blocks, including headless components for use with any UI components library.

## The packages

Initially, all presentation packages were part of the [itwinjs-core](https://github.com/iTwin/itwinjs-core) repository, releasing in lock-step with the core packages. At some point, some of the packages were moved to this repository, which broke them out of lock-step and allowed them to have their own, much quicker, release cycle. However, the moved packages are still tightly coupled with the ones in core repository. Both - the Presentation packages in [itwinjs-core](https://github.com/iTwin/itwinjs-core) repository and the ones that we moved to this one - are considered _legacy_ packages:

| Package                                                                                                                   | Description                                                                                                                                              |

| [`@itwin/presentation-backend`](https://github.com/iTwin/itwinjs-core/tree/master/presentation/backend/README.md)         | APIs for querying presentation data directly from iModels on the backend.                                                                                |

| [`@itwin/presentation-components`](https://github.com/iTwin/presentation/tree/master/packages/components/README.md)       | React components and their building blocks to display presentation data to users. Uses `@itwin/presentation-frontend` peer dependency to query the data. |

While the _legacy_ packages are still maintained and contain some APIs that have no replacements, they're gradually being replaced by _new generation_ packages:

| Package                                                                                                                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | When to use                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| [`@itwin/presentation-hierarchies-react`](https://github.com/iTwin/presentation/tree/master/packages/hierarchies-react/README.md) | APIs for building a headless UI for rendering tree components based on data in an [iModel](https://www.itwinjs.org/learning/imodels/). Also contains a set of [iTwinUI](https://github.com/iTwin/iTwinUI/tree/main/packages/itwinui-react)-based components for rendering the tree. | You're creating a React application and want a tree component.                                                                                                                               |
| [`@itwin/presentation-hierarchies`](https://github.com/iTwin/presentation/tree/master/packages/hierarchies/README.md)             | APIs for creating hierarchical data structures.

While most of them are used by the above packages, some might be useful when defining your hierarchies, getting instance labels, etc. |
| [`@itwin/presentation-core-interop`](https://github.com/iTwin/presentation/tree/master/packages/core-interop/README.md)           | Interop layer between [itwinjs-core](https://github.com/iTwin/itwinjs-core) and _new generation_ Presentation packages.                                                                                                                                                             | You're using the above packages within an iTwin.js-based application.                                                                                                                        |

The _new generation_ packages are designed to be more modular and have less peer dependencies, making them easier to consume.

The below diagram shows the typical dependency structure of a React application or component that uses Presentation packages to create a tree component:
