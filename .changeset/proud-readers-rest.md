`PresentationInstanceFilterDialog` now allows applying filter when only classes are selected.

Added `createInstanceFilterDefinition` that creates `InstanceFilterDefinition` from `PresentationInstanceFilterInfo`. Created definition can be passed to `PresentationManager` to filter results when creating content or hierarchies.
