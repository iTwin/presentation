Split `getActions` into  `getMenuActions` & `getInlineActions` for `StrataKitTreeRenderer` and `StrataKitTreeNodeRenderer`.

Updated peer dependencies:

- @stratakit/bricks@0.3.3
- @stratakit/foundations@0.2.2
- @stratakit/structures@0.3.1

Added `reserveSpace` property to `FilterAction` and `RenameAction`, which reserves space for the action when it is not available
