"@itwin/unified-selection": minor
---

Add support for Models and SubCategories selection that's going to be available in `@itwin/core-frontend` version `5`.

The changes in `@itwin/core-frontend` allow us to stop manually syncing `HiliteSet` with `SelectionSet` and rely on automatic syncing instead.
