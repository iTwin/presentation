Improved numeric and quantity property editors keyboard interactions and changed quantity editor placeholders to display only units.

- Quantity editor placeholders now show only the unit label instead of full formatted values.
- Escape key now calls `onCancel`.
- Enter key commits changes and removes focus from the input.
